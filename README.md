# izak-lib

a simple JavaScript library for bitmap image manipulation

<img align="right" src="https://raw.github.com/drummyfish/izak-lib/master/izak.png" width="256">

This is a KISS, lightweight JavaScript library for basic and advanced bitmap image
manipulation/processing. You can use it to load images from file and work with them
using simple object-oriented API providing access to individual pixels and common
image processing functionality such as filtering, DCT etc. The library is contained
within one file (izaklib.js), but there is also an HTML file containing simple tool
based on the library, but you can ignore the other files and only use the library if
you want. The file contains documentation in form of documentation-system comments.
The goal is to keep everything as simple and clean as possible to be able to use the library
and/or the tool to quickly perform image processing, speed is not primary goal
but everything is reasonably fast.

FAQ
---

**Q: What can it do?**

A: Basic and more advanced bitmap image processing/manipulation. See feature list below.
   Also note that this is work-in-progress and only some features are implemented at the
   moment.
   
**Q: What is the tool for?**

A: It is a tool that lets the user use the library directly in web browser, load images using input
   elements, directly display results and other things, such as download multiple processed images
   in zip archive, which is handy when for example animation is being made.

**Q: How do I use it?**

A: Just download and include the izaklib.js file. You will want to look at Image class
   first. See the documentation comments or generate yourself a documentation. To use the
   tool download all the files and open editor.html with your web browser.

**Q: What does the name mean?**

A: Iz√°k is a name of my cat. If you want something meaningful, it means Image Zero Agitation Kit.

**Q: License?**

A: GPL
